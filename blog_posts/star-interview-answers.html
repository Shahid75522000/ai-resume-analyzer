        <h1>STAR Method: Behavioural Interview Answers (2026 Guide)</h1>
        <p>Use the STAR format to answer questions like “Tell me about a time when…” with confidence and structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">

        <p>
            Behavioural questions like “Tell me about a time you handled pressure” are very common in 2026 interviews.
            The best way to answer them is using the <span class="highlight">STAR method</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the STAR Method?</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>S – Situation:</strong> Background / context</li>
                <li><strong>T – Task:</strong> What you had to do</li>
                <li><strong>A – Action:</strong> Steps you took</li>
                <li><strong>R – Result:</strong> Outcome (with numbers if possible)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Tell me about a time you worked under pressure.</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <strong>Sample STAR Answer:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Situation:</strong> “In my current MIS role, month-end reporting used to be delayed because data
            from different teams came in late.”<br>
            <strong>Task:</strong> “I had to complete the monthly management dashboard on time for leadership
            review.”<br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> “I created a standardized Excel template and automated parts of the report using
            Power Query, so data from all teams could be refreshed quickly.”<br>
            <strong>Result:</strong> “This reduced the reporting time by 40% and we consistently delivered the report
            before the deadline.”
        </div>

        <h2>2. Tell me about a time you solved a data problem.</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <strong>Sample STAR Answer:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Situation:</strong> “Our sales and inventory numbers were not matching between two systems.”<br>
            <strong>Task:</strong> “I was asked to find the root cause and correct the reports.”<br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> “I used SQL to compare transaction IDs, identified missing mappings and created a
            reconciliation logic in Power BI.”<br>
            <strong>Result:</strong> “We fixed the discrepancy and improved data accuracy by around 20%, which restored
            management confidence in the reports.”
        </div>

        <h2>3. Tell me about a time you improved a process.</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <strong>Sample STAR Answer:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Situation:</strong> “My team was manually preparing daily Excel reports, which took 2–3 hours every
            morning.”<br>
            <strong>Task:</strong> “I wanted to reduce manual effort and errors.”<br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> “I automated the report using Power Query and macros, and later built a Power BI
            dashboard connected to the data source.”<br>
            <strong>Result:</strong> “The daily reporting time reduced from 2 hours to 15 minutes, freeing up time for
            analysis instead of only data preparation.”
        </div>

        <h2>4. Tell me about a conflict you handled in the team.</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <strong>Sample STAR Answer:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Situation:</strong> “Two team members disagreed on the way of calculating a KPI.”<br>
            <strong>Task:</strong> “I had to help align everyone on a single standard.”<br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> “I collected the business requirement, checked how leadership wanted the metric
            reported, and documented a clear definition in our report SOP.”<br>
            <strong>Result:</strong> “Everyone started using the same logic, which eliminated confusion and made the
            reports consistent.”
        </div>

        <h2>5. STAR Method Tips</h2>

        <div class="tip-box">
            ✔ Keep answers 1.5–2 minutes long<br>
            ✔ Focus on your <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Result</strong><br>
            ✔ Use numbers wherever possible (%, hours saved, etc.)<br>
            ✔ Prepare 3–4 STAR stories in advance (automation, conflict, pressure, error fix)
        </div>

        <p>
            Practising STAR answers will make you sound structured and confident, and will strongly improve your
            performance in HR and Managerial rounds.
